## 💾 Session Recap Prompt (for ChatGPT)
> I’m working on **Deepcore: The Dwarven Descent**, a Unity roguelike mining game where you click ores on a shrinking funnel-shaped grid to dig deeper, earn score, and pick upgrade cards.  
> The game has meta upgrades, a dwarven mining theme, and uses low-poly art.  
> We’ve built a full GDD, funnel-shrink system, ore values, upgrade structure, and Obsidian project organization.  
> Please continue helping me design, implement, or polish specific systems, assets, or balance ideas.
